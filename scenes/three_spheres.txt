# key
# i <width> <height> - image dimensions
# s <samples> - number of samples
# e <x> <y> <z> - eye, or camera location in world space
# l <x1> <y1> <z1> <x2> <y2> <z2> <x3> <y3> <z3> - lower left corner
#   First three are the coordinates of the lower left corner of the image in
#   world space.
#   Next three are the location of the lower-right corner, relative to the LLC
#   Next three are the location of the upper-left corner, relative to the LLC
#   These usually match the ratio of the image dimensions.
# S <x> <y> <z> <r> <material> - Sphere
#   First three are the coordinates of the sphere in world space.
#   r is the radius of the sphere
#   material is the name of the material declared below
# M <name> <albedo> <r> <g> <b> [roughness] - material declaration
#   name is the name of the material, referenced in Sphere
#   albedo is the albedo (reflectiveness) of the material
#   r, g, and b are floats from 0 to 1 indicating color. Multiply by 255 to get RGB.
#   roughness is a parameter for metallic materials. If this value is omitted,
#   the material is considered to be lambertian
